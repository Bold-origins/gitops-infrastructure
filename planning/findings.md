# Local Environment Testing Findings

## Current State

We've tested the local environment setup process and identified several issues that need to be resolved for the GitOps workflow to function properly.

### Components Status

- **Kubernetes Core**: Working correctly (minikube running with 6GB RAM, 4 CPUs)
- **Ingress-Nginx**: Deployed and running correctly
- **Flux Controllers**: Running, but GitRepository resource is missing
- **Component Namespaces**: Created, but no resources deployed:
  - cert-manager
  - metallb-system
  - observability
  - supabase
  - Vault namespace does not exist

### Issues Summary

1. **Flux GitOps Configuration Incomplete**

   - GitRepository resource is missing
   - Without this, Flux can't sync with the Git repository
   - Components won't be automatically deployed
   - **Script Analysis**:
     - setup-flux.sh checks for GitHub credentials and runs bootstrap correctly
     - However, the bootstrap process appears to fail in creating the GitRepository resource
     - Flux controllers are installed but GitRepository isn't created
     - The script applies flux-kustomization.yaml but it can't work without GitRepository

2. **Component Deployment Failure**

   - Scripts create namespaces but don't deploy components
   - This could be due to:
     - Improper application of Kubernetes manifests
     - Dependencies between scripts not properly managed
     - Flux not configured to deploy the components
   - **Script Analysis**:
     - setup-core-infrastructure.sh creates namespaces and attempts to apply kustomizations
     - It uses `kubectl apply -k "clusters/local/infrastructure/${component}"`
     - The kustomization may be failing due to incorrect paths or missing resources
     - Component dependencies may be incorrectly ordered

3. **Verification Script False Positives**
   - Reports cert-manager and sealed-secrets as running when no pods exist
   - check_component() function has logic issues
   - **Script Analysis**:
     - verify-environment.sh checks for namespace existence but doesn't properly verify pods
     - It has conditional logic that may be incorrectly reporting success

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Flux GitOps Configuration

- Update setup-flux.sh to properly create GitRepository resource
- Ensure it points to the correct repository: Bold-origins/gitops-infrastructure
- Check if secret for repository access is properly created

### 2. Fix Component Deployment Scripts

- Update scripts to properly apply Kubernetes manifests
- Ensure dependency ordering is correct
- Consider removing redundant steps if Flux should be handling deployments

### 3. Fix Verification Script

- Update check_component() function to correctly validate component health
- Add more detailed checks for each specific component
- Consider adding API version checks to validate resources exist

### 4. Testing Process

- Reset environment completely before testing: `minikube delete`
- Run setup with correct environment variables
- Use verification script to validate all components
- Test accessing services through ingress

### 5. Documentation

- Document the correct order of script execution
- Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Update workflow documentation to clarify GitOps vs manual approaches

## Next Steps Priority

1. Fix Flux GitOps configuration
2. Test if this resolves component deployment issues
3. Update verification script for accurate reporting
4. Document workflow for future reference

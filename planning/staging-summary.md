# Staging Environment Setup Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### Server Setup
- Provisioned a VPS with IP 91.108.112.146 (subnet 91.108.112.0/24)
- Created a non-root user `boldman` with sudo privileges
- Configured SSH key authentication and disabled password login
- Disabled root login for enhanced security
- Set up basic firewall rules (UFW) allowing only necessary ports

### Kubernetes Installation
- Installed k3s v1.31.6+k3s1 on the VPS
- Configured local kubectl access to the remote cluster
- Deployed and verified a test application (Nginx)
- Confirmed external access to the application

### GitOps Structure
- Created a complete directory structure for the staging environment:
  - `clusters/staging/` with all necessary subdirectories
  - Kustomization files for all components
  - Flux configuration files
  - Application manifests
  - Infrastructure configurations
  - Observability stack structure

### Domain Configuration
- Set up configuration for domain: boldorigins.io
- Configured staging subdomain: staging.boldorigins.io
- Set up TLS certificate issuers with Let's Encrypt
- Added admin email: rodrigo.mourey@boldorigins.io
- Configured DNS records for staging domain and subdomains

### Infrastructure Components
- Configured core infrastructure components:
  - Sealed Secrets for secure credentials management
  - Vault for secrets management
  - MinIO for object storage
  - Gatekeeper for policy enforcement
  - Ingress controller for external access
  - MetalLB for load balancing

### Observability Stack
- Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging:
  - Prometheus for metrics collection
  - Grafana for visualization
  - Loki for log aggregation
  - Tempo for distributed tracing
  - OpenTelemetry for telemetry collection
  - Network monitoring tools

### Application Deployment
- Configured Supabase application for the staging environment
- Set up resource limits and persistence appropriate for staging
- Configured ingress rules for application access

### Deployment Pipeline
- Created Flux CD installation scripts:
  - Generic Flux installation script (`setup-flux.sh`)
  - Staging-specific installation script (`install-flux-staging.sh`)
- Configured GitOps workflow for automatic deployments
- Prepared initial Flux kustomizations for infrastructure, observability, and applications

## Current State

The staging environment now has:
- A secure VPS with k3s installed
- A working test application
- A complete GitOps directory structure ready for deployment
- Basic firewall rules in place
- Domain and DNS configuration prepared
- TLS certificate configuration ready
- All infrastructure components configured
- Complete observability stack ready for deployment
- Application configurations prepared
- Flux CD installation scripts ready to be executed

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Flux CD Installation**
   - Run the `install-flux-staging.sh` script to install Flux on the staging cluster
   - Set up GitHub authentication with a personal access token
   - Verify Flux controllers are running correctly

2. **Verify GitOps Configuration Deployment**
   - Monitor the deployment of infrastructure components
   - Ensure observability stack is deployed correctly
   - Verify application deployments

3. **Complete Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure alerts and notifications
   - Set up custom dashboards
   - Implement SLO/SLI tracking

4. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tool
   - Configure automated testing and deployment

5. **Test and Validate**
   - Test all components in the staging environment
   - Validate application functionality
   - Perform security scanning

## Long-term Considerations

- Regular backups of cluster state and data
- Upgrade strategy for k3s and applications
- Security scanning and hardening
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Disaster recovery planning

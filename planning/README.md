# Staging Environment Planning

This directory contains the planning documentation for our staging environment setup built on k3s.

## Directory Structure

- **[infrastructure/](./infrastructure/)** - Documentation for infrastructure components
  - [k3s-setup.md](./infrastructure/k3s-setup.md) - Installation and configuration of k3s

- **[deployments/](./deployments/)** - Deployment strategies and patterns
  - [deployment-strategy.md](./deployments/deployment-strategy.md) - Overall deployment approach for the staging environment

- **[security/](./security/)** - Security planning and considerations
  - [security-measures.md](./security/security-measures.md) - Security measures implemented and planned

## Current State

See the [staging-summary.md](./staging-summary.md) file for a comprehensive overview of the staging environment setup.

See the [PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md) file for the detailed progress tracking of the staging environment setup.

## Next Steps

1. Install Flux CD on the staging cluster
2. Deploy the GitOps configuration to the cluster
3. Test monitoring and logging components
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline for deployments
5. Implement application rollout strategy

## Staging Environment Goals

1. **Isolated Environment**: Provide an environment that closely mimics production
2. **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data
3. **Automation**: Automate deployment processes for consistency and reliability
4. **Observability**: Set up monitoring and logging for better visibility
5. **Performance Testing**: Enable testing of application performance before production deployment

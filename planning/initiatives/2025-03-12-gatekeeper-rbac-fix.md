# Gatekeeper RBAC Fix Initiative

## Purpose
This initiative addresses the current RBAC permission issues with Gatekeeper that are blocking Flux reconciliation. Gatekeeper's webhook is failing to initialize properly due to insufficient permissions, which is preventing Flux from successfully reconciling resources.

## Scope
- Fix RBAC configuration for Gatekeeper in a GitOps-compliant way
- Ensure proper communication between Flux and Gatekeeper components
- Document the solution and lessons learned
- Update relevant kustomization files

## Dependencies
- Flux system components
- Gatekeeper deployment
- RBAC resources (ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding)
- HelmRelease configuration for Gatekeeper

## Analysis

### Current Issues
1. Gatekeeper controller-manager pod is unable to list secrets in its own namespace
2. Gatekeeper controller-manager pod lacks permissions to manage ValidatingWebhookConfigurations
3. This prevents the webhook service from becoming available
4. Flux reconciliation is blocked by webhook validation failures

### Root Cause Analysis
The Gatekeeper HelmRelease patch specifies namespaces for component HelmRepositories but does not include proper RBAC configurations required by Gatekeeper. This appears to be a common issue when deploying Gatekeeper through GitOps tools like Flux.

## Revised Action Plan

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement a phased approach to deploy core infrastructure first:
   - Namespaces
   - Cert-Manager
   - Sealed-Secrets
   - Ingress Controller
   - MetalLB
2. Temporarily exclude Gatekeeper and other non-critical components
3. Once core infrastructure is stable, reintroduce Gatekeeper with proper RBAC
4. Update all HelmReleases to correctly reference their namespace-scoped HelmRepositories

### Medium-term Actions (GitOps-compliant)
1. Create a proper ClusterRoleBinding for the Gatekeeper controller-manager ServiceAccount
2. Fix the Gatekeeper HelmRelease to include the necessary RBAC configurations
3. Update relevant kustomization files to include the new RBAC resources
4. Push changes to the repository and let Flux reconcile

### Long-term Improvements
1. Add better validation for RBAC configurations in the CI pipeline
2. Create comprehensive documentation for troubleshooting Gatekeeper issues
3. Implement monitoring for Gatekeeper webhook availability

## Testing
1. Verify core infrastructure components deploy successfully
2. Once stable, add Gatekeeper back and verify pods are running correctly without restarts
3. Validate that Flux can reconcile resources without webhook errors
4. Test that Gatekeeper policies are properly enforced

## Rollback
If the changes cause additional issues:
1. Revert the commits related to the problematic component
2. Push the reverted changes to the repository
3. Monitor Flux reconciliation to ensure system returns to a stable state

## Timeline
- Day 1: Implement core infrastructure components
- Day 2: Verify core infrastructure stability, then implement Gatekeeper RBAC fixes
- Day 3: Test and document solution, update relevant documentation
- Day 4: Review implementation and ensure stability

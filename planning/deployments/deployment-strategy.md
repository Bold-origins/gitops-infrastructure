# Deployment Strategy for Staging Environment

## Deployment Pipeline

### CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tool

- [ ] Configure authentication and authorization
- [ ] Implement image scanning
- [ ] Set up image pruning policy

## Deployment Patterns

### GitOps Approach

- [ ] Maintain infrastructure as code
- [ ] Track deployments through Git history
- [ ] Implement automated reconciliation

### Deployment Strategies

- [ ] Implement blue/green deployments where needed
- [ ] Configure proper readiness and liveness probes

## Resource Management

### Namespace Structure

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- [ ] Configure regular state backups
- [ ] Set up database backups

- [ ] Test recovery scenarios
- [ ] Set up recovery automation where possible

## Testing in Staging

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests

- [ ] Configure performance testing

### Manual Testing Procedures
- [ ] Define QA process
- [ ] Document testing checklists
- [ ] Establish signoff procedures

## Promotion to Production
- [ ] Define criteria for promotion to production
- [ ] Implement promotion workflows
- [ ] Configure production-specific overrides
- [ ] Document rollback procedures

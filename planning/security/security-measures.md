# Security Measures for Staging Environment

## Server-Level Security (Implemented)

### SSH Hardening
- [x] Created non-root user `boldman` with sudo privileges
- [x] Configured SSH key authentication
- [x] Disabled password authentication
- [x] Disabled SSH root login
- [ ] Implement SSH login notifications

### System Hardening
- [ ] Configure automatic security updates
- [ ] Set up fail2ban to protect against brute force attacks
- [ ] Configure firewall rules (UFW/iptables)
- [ ] Remove unnecessary packages and services
- [ ] Implement secure disk encryption for sensitive data

## Kubernetes-Level Security

### Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Configure RBAC policies
- [ ] Define appropriate service accounts for workloads
- [ ] Implement minimal permissions principle
- [ ] Use namespaces to isolate workloads

### Network Security
- [ ] Implement network policies to restrict pod communication
- [ ] Configure secure ingress with TLS
- [ ] Set up network segmentation
- [ ] Implement API server access restrictions

### Container Security
- [ ] Scan images for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Use minimal base images
- [ ] Run containers as non-root users
- [ ] Implement pod security policies/security contexts
- [ ] Set resource limits for all containers

### Secret Management
- [ ] Encrypt secrets at rest
- [ ] Rotate secrets regularly
- [ ] Implement proper secret injection methods
- [ ] Consider external secret management solutions

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Logging
- [ ] Centralize and retain logs
- [ ] Set up log analysis for security events
- [ ] Implement audit logging for k8s activities

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activities
- [ ] Monitor resource usage for anomalies
- [ ] Configure monitoring for critical security controls

### Incident Response
- [ ] Create incident response procedures
- [ ] Document recovery processes
- [ ] Implement regular security drills

## Security Testing

### Regular Assessments
- [ ] Schedule vulnerability scans
- [ ] Perform penetration testing
- [ ] Review security configurations regularly

## Compliance Documentation
- [ ] Document all security measures
- [ ] Create security runbooks
- [ ] Maintain change logs for security configurations

## GitOps Workflow

Our GitOps workflow follows these principles:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - All environment configurations stored in Git
   - Kustomize used for environment-specific overlays
   - Common configurations stored in base directory

2. **Pull-Based Deployments**:
   - Flux monitors repository for changes
   - Changes to environment directories trigger deployments
   - No direct cluster modifications outside the GitOps workflow

3. **Progressive Deployment**:
   - Changes flow from local → staging → production
   - Each environment serves as validation for the next
   - Promotion scripts facilitate proper configuration transfer

## Branching and Promotion Strategy

```
feature/xyz       ┌───┬───┬───┐
                  │   │   │   │
                  ▼   ▼   ▼   ▼          PR Review
main        ●────●───●───●────●────────▶ (Validate all
            │                             environments)
            │
            │                  Promote to Staging
clusters/local    *───*───*────►  clusters/staging   
                                           │
                                           │
                                           ▼        Promote to Production
                                     clusters/production
```

1. **Feature Development**:
   - Create feature branch from main
   - Implement changes in local environment
   - Test in local Minikube cluster

2. **Code Review**:
   - PR to main includes changes to all affected environments
   - CI validates configurations for each environment
   - Team reviews with special attention to environment differences

3. **Promotion**:
   - After changes are verified in local, promote to staging
   - After verification in staging, promote to production
   - Use promotion scripts to ensure consistent configurations

## Integration with CI/CD

Our CI/CD pipeline will be implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 0-1**: Manual verification, local testing
2. **Phase 2**: Automated testing and deployment to staging
3. **Phase 3-4**: Complete pipeline with production deployment

The CI/CD system will:
- Validate Kubernetes manifests for correctness
- Build and test application components
- Deploy to the appropriate environment based on branch
- Provide deployment status notifications
- Execute integration tests
- Support manual approval gates for production

## Success Metrics

We will measure the success of our deployment workflow by:

1. **Deployment Frequency**: How often we can safely deploy changes
2. **Lead Time**: Time from code commit to production deployment
3. **Change Failure Rate**: Percentage of deployments causing incidents
4. **Mean Time to Recovery**: Time to recover from failures

## Conclusion

By implementing Phase 0 before proceeding to Phase 2, we ensure our GitOps workflow is properly structured from the beginning. This will provide a solid foundation for scaling our deployment process across environments while maintaining consistency and reliability.

# Kubernetes Cluster Diagnostic Report

## Overview

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Kubernetes cluster running on Minikube. It includes information about the cluster's health, GitOps configuration, security posture, and recommendations for addressing identified issues.

## Environment Details

- **Kubernetes Version**: v1.32.0
- **Node Count**: 1 (Minikube)
- **Environment**: local
- **Namespaces**: 14
- **Resource Constraints**: Running on Minikube with limited resources (2 CPUs, 2GB RAM, 20GB disk)

## Cluster Health

The Kubernetes control plane components are running normally. All core components including:
- kube-apiserver
- kube-controller-manager
- kube-scheduler
- etcd
- coredns

are in a healthy state.

## GitOps (Flux) Status

The Flux system is operational but has several reconciliation issues:

- **Working Components**:
  - The `flux-system` kustomization is successfully applied
  - The `gatekeeper` Helm release is successfully deployed

- **Issues Detected**:
  - Several Helm repositories are not found:
    - `jetstack` (for cert-manager)
    - `minio` (for MinIO)
    - `sealed-secrets` (for Sealed Secrets)
    - `hashicorp` (for Vault)
  - The `supabase` Helm release failed to upgrade due to a context deadline exceeded error

## Application Workloads

There are 17 pods in an unhealthy state, primarily with the following issues:
- `CreateContainerConfigError` - Likely due to missing configuration or secrets
- `Init:CreateContainerConfigError` - Issues during initialization phase
- Some pods in `Completed` state (which may be expected for job-type workloads)

The majority of problematic pods are in the `supabase` namespace, suggesting configuration issues with this application.

## Security Posture

The security assessment identified:
- Gatekeeper policies are properly deployed
- Network policies are in place to restrict traffic between namespaces
- Pod Security Standards are enforced

## Resource Constraints

The cluster is running on Minikube with limited resources, which may contribute to some of the observed issues:
- 2 CPUs
- 2GB RAM
- 20GB disk space

These constraints may impact the ability to run resource-intensive applications and may cause timeouts during operations like Helm chart installations.

## Recommendations

Based on the diagnostic findings, here are the recommended next steps:

1. **Fix Helm Repository Issues**
   - Ensure that the Flux HelmRepository resources have the correct URLs
   - Verify network connectivity to the Helm repositories
   - Check for any proxy or firewall settings that might be blocking access

2. **Troubleshoot Supabase Deployment**
   - Investigate the `CreateContainerConfigError` issues
   - Check for missing ConfigMaps, Secrets, or PersistentVolumeClaims
   - Consider increasing the timeout for the Helm release to address the context deadline exceeded error

3. **Optimize for Resource Constraints**
   - Disable non-essential components to free up resources
   - Adjust resource requests and limits for critical workloads
   - Consider increasing Minikube's allocated resources if possible

4. **Implement Regular Diagnostics**
   - Run the diagnostic scripts regularly to monitor cluster health
   - Use the lightweight mode for routine checks to minimize resource usage
   - Create alerts for persistent issues

## Conclusion

The Kubernetes cluster is operational but facing several configuration and resource-related challenges. By addressing the Helm repository issues and optimizing for the resource-constrained environment, the cluster's stability and functionality can be significantly improved.

For detailed diagnostic information, refer to the individual reports in the `diagnostics/reports/local/` directory.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the recommendations outlined in this report
2. Re-run diagnostics after making changes to verify improvements
3. Consider creating a more detailed troubleshooting guide for common issues encountered in this environment

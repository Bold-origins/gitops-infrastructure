## Environment Overview

- Kubernetes Version: v1.32.0
- Node Count: 1
- Environment: local
- Namespaces: 14

## Control Plane Health

✅ Control plane components appear to be running normally.

## GitOps (Flux) Status

✅ Flux system appears to be reconciling normally.

## Application Workloads

✅ All application pods appear to be running normally.

## Resource Constraints

This cluster is running on Minikube with limited resources. Some issues may be related to resource constraints:

- Check container resource limits if pods are being evicted or failing to start
- Consider prioritizing necessary workloads by disabling non-critical applications
- Monitor resource usage and adjust Minikube VM resources if needed

## Recommendations

Based on the diagnostic findings, here are the recommended next steps:

3. **Optimize for resource constraints** - This Minikube environment has limited resources
   ```
   # Consider disabling unneeded components
   kubectl scale deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME --replicas=0 -n NAMESPACE
   ```

For more detailed diagnostics, run the diagnostic scripts without the 'light' parameter.

# Phase 1 Diagnostic Summary - Tue Mar  4 20:29:23 CET 2025

## Environment Overview

- Kubernetes Version: v1.32.0
- Node Count: 1
- Environment: local
- Namespaces: 14

## Control Plane Health

✅ Control plane components appear to be running normally.

## GitOps (Flux) Status

✅ Flux system appears to be reconciling normally.

## Application Workloads

⚠️ **ISSUE DETECTED**: 3 pods are in an unhealthy state.

Problem pods:
example                example-app-5c45569fb7-c8fqb                     0/1     CreateContainerConfigError   0               9h
ingress-nginx          ingress-nginx-admission-create-rsb5k             0/1     Completed                    0               23h
ingress-nginx          ingress-nginx-admission-patch-5srvs              0/1     Completed                    1               23h

## Resource Constraints

This cluster is running on Minikube with limited resources. Some issues may be related to resource constraints:

- Check container resource limits if pods are being evicted or failing to start
- Consider prioritizing necessary workloads by disabling non-critical applications
- Monitor resource usage and adjust Minikube VM resources if needed

## Recommendations

Based on the diagnostic findings, here are the recommended next steps:

1. **Troubleshoot failing pods** - Investigate the pods in error state
   ```
   kubectl describe pod POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE
   kubectl logs POD_NAME -n NAMESPACE
   ```
3. **Optimize for resource constraints** - This Minikube environment has limited resources
   ```
   # Consider disabling unneeded components
   kubectl scale deployment DEPLOYMENT_NAME --replicas=0 -n NAMESPACE
   ```

For more detailed diagnostics, run the diagnostic scripts without the 'light' parameter.

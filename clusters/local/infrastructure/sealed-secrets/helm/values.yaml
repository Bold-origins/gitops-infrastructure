# Values for Sealed Secrets Helm chart
# Reference: https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/tree/main/helm/sealed-secrets

# NOTE: There was an issue with the v0.24.5 controller:
# 1. The --key-label flag caused crashes as it doesn't exist in this version
# 2. The service account needs to be explicitly set in the deployment
# These issues are fixed in the release.yaml configuration.

## Automation and Tooling

### End-to-End Testing Framework

For complete validation of the local Kubernetes environment, we've developed a comprehensive end-to-end testing script:

- **e2e-test.sh**: Single-command setup and validation of the entire environment
  - Creates a fresh Minikube cluster
  - Installs and configures all components
  - Runs all tests
  - Reports detailed results
  - Optionally preserves or deletes the cluster
  - Highly configurable with command-line options
  - Designed for both manual testing and CI/CD integration

This tool provides the ultimate validation of the environment by testing everything from scratch, ensuring a completely clean setup without any pre-existing configuration that might mask issues.

### Testing and Validation Tooling

To ensure proper setup and functionality, we've developed a comprehensive testing framework:

- **test-all.sh**: End-to-end testing of the entire local environment
  - Runs all test scripts in sequence
  - Provides comprehensive summary of results
  - Identifies issues across all components
- **test-environment.sh**: Core infrastructure and component testing
  - Validates all core components are running
  - Checks GitOps directory structure
  - Verifies Kubernetes resources
- **test-web-interfaces.sh**: Web interface and connectivity testing
  - Checks domain resolution
  - Tests accessibility of all web interfaces
  - Provides diagnostics for failed access
- **test-gitops-workflow.sh**: GitOps workflow validation
  - Tests end-to-end Flux reconciliation
  - Verifies Git repository synchronization
  - Validates resource creation, updates, and pruning

These tools ensure comprehensive validation of the local environment and help quickly identify and resolve issues.

### GitOps Refactoring Tooling

To streamline the refactoring process, we've developed several automation scripts:

- **refactor-workflow.sh**: End-to-end workflow script for refactoring components
  - Backs up existing configuration
  - Creates patches for local-specific settings
  - Tests the refactored component
  - Cleans up redundant files
  - Updates progress tracking documents
- **refactor-component.sh**: Core refactoring script (used by the workflow)
  - Converts components to reference base configuration
  - Creates template patch files for common resource types
  - Preserves local-specific values
- **cleanup-local-refactoring.sh**: Removes redundant files after refactoring
  - Backs up removed files
  - Preserves only necessary configuration
  - Handles all component types automatically
- **verify-local-refactoring.sh**: Verifies correct refactoring
  - Checks all components across all types
  - Ensures proper reference to base
  - Identifies redundant files
  - Validates with kustomize
  - Provides detailed report and recommendations

These tools ensure consistent refactoring across all components and maintain proper progress tracking.

### GitOps Workflow

Our GitOps workflow follows these principles:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**:

   - All environment configurations stored in Git
   - Kustomize used for environment-specific overlays
   - Common configurations stored in base directory
   - Standardized naming across environments (observability over monitoring)

2. **Pull-Based Deployments**:

   - Flux monitors repository for changes
   - Changes to environment directories trigger deployments
   - No direct cluster modifications outside the GitOps workflow

3. **Progressive Deployment**:
   - Changes flow from local → staging → production
   - Each environment serves as validation for the next
   - Promotion scripts facilitate proper configuration transfer

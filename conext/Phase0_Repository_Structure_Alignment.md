## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create Base Configuration Directory

```bash
mkdir -p clusters/base/{infrastructure,observability,applications,policies}
```

Extract common configurations from the local environment into the base directory:

- Core infrastructure components (cert-manager, sealed-secrets, vault, etc.)
- Observability stack base configurations (prometheus, grafana, loki, opentelemetry, network monitoring)
- Application templates and shared resources
- Policy components (constraints and templates)

### Step 2: Refactor Local Environment as Kustomize Overlay

Update `clusters/local/` to reference base configurations using Kustomize overlays:

- Keep only local-specific overrides (resource limits, local domains, etc.)
- Update `kustomization.yaml` files to reference the corresponding base components
- Standardize on consistent namespace naming (observability, not monitoring)
- Ensure directory structure matches between base and local environments
- Test to ensure functionality remains identical to the previous structure

## Progress Updates

### 2025-03-11 (Continued)

- Reorganized scripts directory to improve maintainability:
  - Created a logical directory structure: gitops, cluster, components, legacy, promotion
  - Moved scripts to appropriate directories based on their functionality
  - Created detailed README documentation for each directory
  - Removed redundant and obsolete scripts
  - Added placeholder for upcoming promotion workflow scripts
- This restructuring prepares the repository for the next phases:
  - Step 3: Creating staging and production directory structures
  - Step 4: Implementing promotion workflow
- The scripts organization now aligns with the GitOps pattern and makes it easier to:
  - Find scripts by function
  - Understand the purpose of each script
  - Maintain and extend functionality

### 2025-03-11 (Final Update)

## Notes

- The base directory intentionally does not include flux-system, as Flux is environment-specific. Each environment (local, staging, production) has its own Flux configuration that applies the base resources with appropriate overlays.
- Using Kustomize overlays allows each environment to reference the same base while applying environment-specific patches.
- Patches should only include the specific fields that need to be modified, not the entire resource definition.
- Local-specific resources like ingresses with local domain names need special attention during refactoring.
- For local environment patches, focus on:
  - Reduced resource requirements (CPU/memory limits, replica counts)
  - Development-friendly configurations (simpler security, debug logging)
  - Local network settings (.local domains, self-signed certificates)
  - Development conveniences (faster startup, simplified credentials)
  - Avoiding production-only features (complex HA, strict security, resource-intensive components)
- Workflow scripts have been created to automate and standardize the refactoring process:
  - Use `./scripts/refactor-workflow.sh component-name` for an end-to-end refactoring experience
  - The scripts ensure proper refactoring, testing, and cleanup
  - They also automatically update progress tracking documents

- Local environment cleaning and verification:
  - Use `./scripts/verify-local-refactoring.sh` to check for issues across all components
  - Use `./scripts/cleanup-local-refactoring.sh` to clean up redundant files
  - Always test functionality after cleanup to ensure nothing is broken
  - Verification should be done before moving to Step 3

# Promotion Scripts

This directory will contain scripts for promoting configurations between environments in the GitOps workflow.

## Planned Scripts

- `promote-component.sh` - Promotes a single component's configuration between environments
- `promote-environment.sh` - Promotes all components from one environment to another
- `validate-promotion.sh` - Validates that a promotion is safe and compatible
- `generate-environment.sh` - Generates a new environment based on an existing one

## Workflow

The promotion workflow will follow these steps:

1. Validate the source environment configuration
2. Create or update the target environment's component configurations
3. Apply any environment-specific patches
4. Validate the resulting configuration
5. Update progress tracking documentation

## Environments

The promotion path follows this progression:

```
Local → Staging → Production
```

Each step serves as validation for the next environment.

## Status

This directory is a placeholder for upcoming work in Step 4 of the repository structure alignment phase.
